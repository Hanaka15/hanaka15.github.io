      <h4>Episode I</h4>
      <h1>THE PHANTOM CARLOS</h1>
      <p>
        In a galaxy not so far away, chaos erupted as Carlos unleashed a mighty smack, sending a book crashing onto the lecture desk. The class was jolted from their seats, their hearts racing like starfighters in battle. But the disturbance was not over yet. Mysterious numbers danced before their minds, a puzzle that drove them to the brink of insanity.
        <br><br>
        Desperation led the students down a treacherous path, their wallets emptied as they acquired not one, not two, but three tomes of knowledge. Alas, these tomes would gather dust, for their true purpose remained shrouded in mystery.
        <br><br>
        As the clock ticked on, a cunning plan emerged amidst the chaos. The students, united by their struggle, transformed into pseudo DNS Servers, embodying the very essence of the interconnected web they sought to understand. Bits and bytes flowed like the Force, as they demonstrated the intricacies of the digital realm.
        <br><br>
        And so, in this saga of academic turmoil and unity, Carlos' book-smack, the numbers of madness, the futile tomes, and the DNS charade etched their tale into the classroom's historyâ€”a microcosm of the grand galactic tapestry.
